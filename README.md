#  AI-Powered ETL Pipeline (Apache Beam + DuckDB)

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using Apache Beam, Pandas, and DuckDB. It processes Airbnb listing data, performs cleaning and transformation, and stores the final structured data in a database for analytics and visualization.

---

##  ETL Workflow

### 1. Extract

* Reads raw CSV data using Pandas
* Handles missing or inconsistent column formatting

### 2. Transform

* Cleans data (removes unnecessary columns, trims text)
* Performs feature engineering:

  * Categorizes listings into **Low, Medium, High price segments**

### 3. Load

* Saves processed data as CSV
* Stores final dataset in DuckDB for fast querying

##  Tech Stack

* **Apache Beam** → Data processing pipeline
* **Pandas** → Data manipulation
* **DuckDB** → Lightweight analytical database
* **Python** → Core programming language
